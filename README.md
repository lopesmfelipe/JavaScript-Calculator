# JavaScript-Calculator
Calculator application created with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is simple with easy code to help people understand how a calculator works through codes, and how to create one using JS, HTML and CSS

##
This project is intended to be simple, so the calculator can do the four main calculations, but I didn't add calculations with negative numbers or other types. Feel free to contribute if you think it's important.

## Thank You
